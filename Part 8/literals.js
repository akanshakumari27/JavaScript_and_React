//Array:
//Created using the Array constructor:
const fruits = new Array("apple", "orange", "banana");

//Array Literal:
//Created using square brackets []:
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

/* Key Differences:

() Creation syntax: new Array() vs. []
() Flexibility: new Array() allows specifying initial length and dynamic element creation, while [] is limited to static values.
() Built-in methods: Array literals need explicit methods like push and pop through the Array.prototype object, while new Array() offers direct access.
() Use cases: new Array() for dynamic scenarios, [] for static initialization of small arrays. */


/* JavaScript supports various types of literals, including:
Numeric Literal
Floating-Point Literal
Boolean Literal
String Literal
Array Literal // [] Vs new.array().
Regular Expression Literal
Object Literal // {} Vs new.object().
  "Choose object literals for their conciseness when dealing with simple data, {}.
   Use object constructors with classes for complex objects requiring structured data and functionality with inheritance, new.object(), class constructor" */


// There's only subtle differnce between them with their literals.
