Git is a Version Control System (VCS), it's created by Linus Torvalds (the guy who made Linux) in 2005.
It helps developers track changes in code, collaborate with others, and go back to old versions if something breaks.

-> "Git" is a version control system (VCS)
-> "Git Bash" is a terminal (command line tool) for Windows that lets you run Git commands.
-> "GitHub" is a cloud-based platform where you can host Git repositories.

// ** In Git Bash **

 Basics Command
a) ls - list files (show my files)
b) pwd - print working directory (where am i)
c) clear - clear screen

Use UpKeyword to get previous used commands
ViseVersa DownKeyword to later used commands

d) "~" - home directory
e) "/" - root directory
f) cd name - change directory
g) cd name/name2 - change directory by 2 steps forward
h) cd .. - back button of change directory
i) cd ../.. - for two steps back
j) tab - for autocomplete
k) up and down arrow - for suggested and last command used
l) mkdir - making directory (creating new folder of new name, if particular name already exist it won't create and shows error)
   // can create new folder by both absolute and relative path way


# example
  pwd (print current directory)
~ c/users/hp
  ls (we will first check list)
~ "in list alot will be there, we will pick desktop"
  cd desktop
  pwd
~ c/users/hp/desktop
  ls (again to go further more inside we can check list, and again cd __ and can check current directory with pwd)
  cd .. (to jump out one step from current directory)
  cd desktop/delta

 Paths
a) Relative path (it will let you jump from current path to upper)
   // cd desktop/delta
b) Absolute path (it will let you go to final path from any path you were, it doesn't care where you currently are)
   // cd users/akansha/desktop/delta


 Manual Command
1) man ls - give information about "ls" command and also it's flags
2) man mkdir - give information about "mkdir" command and also it's flags

Flags: Flags are characterstics that we pass it with commands with external information to modify their behaviour
ls -l
ls -a 
ls -la
{* In normal terminal might not work, probably works in linux so, 
 wsl (to enter in linux)
 man ls (will show all information now)
 ls -l (now can use such commands)
 exit (to exit from linux) *}

m) Touch Command (used to create new files)
ex: touch abc.html
    touch abc.js
    touch abc.text 
    touch abc
if check it by "man touch" we will, get to know it's actually helps to acess or change file timestamps,
but if that named file doesn't exist it will create that file.
("q" to exit from man, "h" for help)

 Deleting File and Folder
n) rm - remove files {rm abc.html abc.js abc.txt}
o) rmdir - remove empty folder only
p) rm -rf - remove any folder
      {"r" means 'recursive delete', "f" means 'force delete', in combine known as "recursive force"(or can remeber it, "remove by force")}
  // CAUTION: once the file deleted it can't recover {sensitive} [through normal deletion u can restore by recycle bin! but through terminal u can't]
